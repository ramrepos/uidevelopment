# Router/AJAX/Publisher-Subscriber

+   Routers enable SPA (Single Page Applications) development. Routers manipulate browser history to achieve the same.
+   Upon clicking navigation items such as tabs, links in nav pane - routers update the browser history (URL), loads the modules based on the updated URL (router state) without refreshing the entire page.   This makes for a seamless user experience. Entire application feels like a single page, when in fact, there are multiple JS modules that are loaded in place without page refresh.  This renders the application its single page behavior.
+   Data, for individual modules and components within the modules, is typically fetched from REST endpoints using AJAX requests.
