# Router/AJAX/Publisher-Subscriber

+   Routers enables us write SPA (Single Page Applications).  SPAs are possible by manipulating browser history. 
+   Upon clicking a navigation item, routers update the browser history (URL), loads the modules based on the updated URL (router state) without refreshing the entire page.   This makes for a seamless user experience. Entire application looks feels like a single page, when in fact, there are multiple JS modules that are loaded in place without the page refresh.  This renders the application its single page behavior.
+   Data, for individual modules and components within the modules, is typically fetched from REST Endpoints using AJAX requests.
